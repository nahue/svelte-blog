            A brief summary of my professional life.
        </p>

        <p class="text-sm leading-5 text-gray-500 mt-5">
            For the past 15 years, I have been a Full Stack developer, and since
            mid-2014, I developed my DevOps skills. I love traveling, rock
            music, and primarily enjoy life with my fiance.
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm leading-5 text-gray-500 mt-5">
            On a professional level, my experience goes from learning the
            programming basics on Fox 2.6 with my father to manage a physical
            data center on the local government and handle multi-cloud
            environments with Azure and Amazon AWS.
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm leading-5 text-gray-500 mt-5">
            I've also been developing my Full Stack skills with many languages
            such as PHP, Python, Javascript, C#, and a lot of well-known
            frameworks.
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm leading-5 text-gray-500 mt-5">
            I can say I have experience with other aspects of technology such
            as:
        </p>

        <ul class="mt-5 text-sm leading-5 text-gray-500 mt-5 list-disc">
            <li>HTML and CSS for mocking UI's</li>
            <li>
                Databases such as SQL Server, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL and its
                forks (mainly for querying, but I also did some installations
                and essential management)
            </li>
            <li>
                Containers using AWS ECS, Docker, and Kubernetes for building
                Micro Services platforms.
            </li>
            <li>
                Code Integration and Code Delivery using CircleCI and Jenkins.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-sm leading-5 text-gray-500 mt-5">
            I am a constant and fast learner, always trying to improve myself,
            personally and professionally. Also, I can't see myself working
            without a Team, having one pushes me to be better and to teach
            others what I've learned, and that feels very rewarding. My native
            language is Spanish, and I'm also fluent in English (to read, write,
            and talk).
